# SWOT Analysis 

Strengths-  
1.) online banks are able to provide faster and more efficient transactions.
2.) the Internet allows online banks to reduces their costs and thus achieve a cost
advantage.
3.) It results with  more efficiency, faster operations, additional
reduction on costs and achievement of economies of scale.
4.)  Improved customer experience : Several Open Banking specifications have come up with their own customer experience guidelines. These guidelines the customers gain a seamless and frictionless experience with their bank regardless of the TPP application they choose.

Weakness--
1.)Standing on the customers’ perspective, security about personal data and its integrity represents one of
the main issues. 
2.) Online banks need to invest considerable amount of money on security software as thefts of account information and virus attacks towards banks’ databases occur with high frequency
3.) Weakens bank-customer relationship: Because everything is handled digitally, the face-to-face encounters between the customer and the bank are getting smaller. This can lead to a breakdown in the relationship.
4.)  Customers lack a considerable amount of credibility towards Open Banking. It is partly due to the fear of sharing their data, as well as to their lack of knowledge of how it works.

Oppurtunities:--
1.) One of the most profitable opportunities that online banks should take
advantage of is the expansion of financial markets. 
2.) online banks would be able to differentiate their services and thus achieving a competitive advantage not only over other online banks, both domestic and foreign, but also over traditional banks and other financial institutions.
3.)The collaboration between banks and other stakeholders sets the
basis for the implementation of new business strategies which eventually lead
to value creation for both customers and banks.
4.)Another big opportunity is represented by the extensive net of contacts
offered by the Internet. In fact, Internet enhances
communication and networking opening the path for new business
opportunities which involve the collaborations between banks and other newly created professional figures such as online stores and service providers. 

Threats:--
1.0Online banks are threatened by traditional banks which offer
differentiated products, financial institutions which provide specific financial
solutions and above all foreign banks. 
2.) The lack of supervision on online activities and the implementation of effective legal norms prevent online banks from running a flawless business.
3.)  The growth of those companies that have replaced the banks is a major drawback for Open Banking. The Fintech market is growing. Their services are diverse and more and more there in a large number .
